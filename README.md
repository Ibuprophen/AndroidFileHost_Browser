## AndroidFileHost Browser

AFH Browser is an Android app that fetches a list of all files for a given device from AndroidFileHost.com.  
The list of files can be sorted by name or upload date, and a tap opens the AndroidFileHost page for that file, which can then be downloaded.  
  
  

The process of fetching the list of files can be very slow at times. Please give it about 4 minutes to load.
